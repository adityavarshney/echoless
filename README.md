This script analyzes a given twitterHandle's feed to understand the data a person is surrounded with, based off of the friends they follow. Using natural language processing and machine learning classification, we can also gain an understanding of how much "echo" a given twitterhandle has by comparing how similar the posts and the posts they follow are.
